### [1201] Lesson 1: Slow and steady is the goal.
The first lesson you need to understand with this option strategy is this: Your objective here is not to make a daily killing-- but a yearly killing. In other words, you're not looking to make 35% in one month, but 35% in one year. 

In effect by selling options you are taking advantage of those people WHO WANT TO MAKE THE KILLING. You are taking their bets. In other cases, you are giving others insurance on bets they've already made.

Whichever is the case, we do not care.

Your profit objective is a slow and steady drift upward. A correctly positioned account will zig-zag up and down, but usually in an uptrending formation. This is from July 2015.
