### [1201] Lesson 1: Slow and steady is the goal.
The first lesson you need to understand with this option strategy is this: Your objective here is not to make a daily killing-- but a yearly killing. In other words, you're not looking to make 35% in one month, but 35% in one year. 

In effect by selling options you are taking advantage of those people WHO WANT TO MAKE THE KILLING. You are taking their bets. In other cases, you are giving others insurance on bets they've already made.

Whichever is the case, we do not care.

Your profit objective is a slow and steady drift upward. A correctly positioned account will zig-zag up and down, but usually in an uptrending formation. This is from July 2015.

This trade strategy is not sexy. It is boring! 

And BORING IS GOOD because BORING is good for sleeping well. 
### [1202] Lesson 2: Treat this as a business.
I am in the business of taking bets and selling insurance contracts. 

Likewise just like insurance companies do, I also buy REINSURANCE in the case of a market catastrophe. My reinsurance options are always SPX options in the single delta range, like 2-3 delta.

I keep trade logs. Here is a photo of them, 100's of them.
![Exhibit L2E1](/resources/references/IMG_2196.JPG)

The logs allow me to review my thought process as well as review bad trades and analyze patterns, if any. 

These logs have helped me improve my strategy over time.

I don't claim to have some perfect system, but my goal is to simply become more efficient and profitable while managing risk in the business.

### [1203] Lesson 3: Options are risky!
Undoubtedly you've heard, "options are risky!!"

Yup, those same people who are screaming at you that starting a business is risky, are also telling you that options are risky.

So are options truly as risky as everyone claims?

Yes.

But only if you don't know what you are doing.

First, selling options does indeed open you up to UNLIMITED RISK. (Yikes!)

However what people don't realize is this: BUYING STOCK is exactly the same risk as selling a put option -- actually, it is LESS risky when examined theoretically.

* Buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $100, stock goes to $1 -- you lose $9900.
* Sell 1 XYZ put option at $90 strike for $1 -- stock goes to $1, you lose $8900.

Likewise, if you SHORT stock, the same dynamic exists for selling calls.

* Short 100 shares XYZ stock at $100, stock goes to $200 -- you lose $10000.
* Sell XYZ call option at $110 strike for $1 -- stock goes to $200, you lose $8900.

So, in effect, selling PUTS/CALLS is a less risky of a strategy than BUYING or SHORTING stock. The counterargument of course is that buying/shorting has unlimited gain potential.

So, where are the BIG risks in selling options?

By far the big risks in selling options come from binary events, or events that move the stock dramatically, gap ups/downs, etc.

* Earnings misses and makes.
* Takeovers.
* FDA trial results.
* New product developments.

### [1204] Lesson 4: My Trade Criteria (Mitigating Risk)
So over the last year, I've cataloged all my trades and analyzed the big winners/losers/scratches and come to the conclusion that my consistent winners always negated these risks. In other words, my losses always came from A) Takeover chatter or B) Earnings surprises.

So with that knowledge, I stopped trading those instruments and moved toward assets with the following criteria.

1. Stick to assets that have FEW binary events. Binary events are EARNINGS, TAKEOVERS, PHARMA results, etc. I stopped trading stocks with earnings after too many surprises and found that the volatility crush didn't warrant the risk. Now I mainly stick to INDEXES.
2. NEVER sell options on any company that is in the bio-tech or pharmaceutical space.
3. Stick to duration's of 55 days or less. My sweet spot is 20-40 days.
4. My favorite option product is SPX which is a HUGE product. It also has tax favorability with 60% of the gain treated as long-term.
5. For companies, I like to stick with hardline companies that have certain scale challenges -- this usually means RETAIL oriented companies like LULU, Costco, McDonalds -- companies like FB in the digital domain can skyrocket. Selling naked calls here is not advised, use verticals here.
6. For companies, I gravitate to LARGE companies with ZERO take over prospects. No one is taking over McDonalds. McDonald's price will not double in 3 months.
7. Stick to options that are highly liquid with tight bid/asks ... my faves SPY, SPX.
8. Stay small and highly probable -- I tend to focus between 8-25 delta selling one lots only, especially if it's SPX which is a giant product.
9. Anytime you sell an option, your probability of profit is already defined by it's DELTA -- I sell between the 8 and 25 DELTA which means my probability of profit is 75%-92%.
10. When implied volatility is high, I become more active and spread out through the 55 day cycle, when it's lower, I become more passive and docile

### [1205] Lesson 5: Get to Know Your GREEKS
Get to Know Your GREEKS, What They Represent, and HOW They Are Used in Account Management.

Option Delta:
>The probability of your option being ITM or OTM any time during it's life. If I sell a put option with a 30 Delta (.30), that means there will be a 30% chance that put option's strike will be breached, 70% chance it will not. So when we say "high probability trades", we are selling options with very low deltas, giving us a high % chance that we will be profitable. Of course on the flipside, "high probability trades" carry small profits and still carry theoretical unlimited risk.

>1SD = 1 Standard Deviation, or .16 Delta. (16 DELTA)
>2SD = 2 Standard Deviation, or .08 Delta. (8 DELTA)

>Another tool of delta is to measure how the option price will be affected by the underlying's movement. If I sell a 10 delta option, the price of that option would only move about 10% in relation to the underlying's price. As the price moves, so does the delta -- it is always changing.​

Beta-Weighted Delta (BWD):
>The impact a $1 move in the SPY should impact your portfolio. This measurement is critical in managing your positions. Again, I like to stay BWD neutral, which means for me, in between -200 and +200.

>In the screenshot below, I am -600 DELTA which means a $1 UP MOVE in the SPY would cause me to lose approximately $600 in account value. Conversely, a $1 DOWN MOVE in the SPY would cause my account to gain $600.​

Theta:
>Theta stands for time decay, or the cumulative amount your option values should DECLINE by the passage of 1 DAY. THETA IS THE FASTLANING OF THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY. In this example, my THETA is a whopping $528.00 -- that means I stand to make $528 in option depreciation just by sitting on my ass and letting time expire. So on this particular day, if the market was FLAT, I'd still stand to make $500. If the Market goes DOWN by $1, I'd stand to earn $1,100. If it went up by $1, I'd lose about $100.

>This, "I win 2 out of 3 occurrences" in the market is the fundamental essence on how we like to see our accounts structured.

>Now mind you, this account snapshot is not typical because my SPX options where near expiration, hence the big Delta and theta.​

VEGA:
>A very important measure that determines how your options will price/decline with a $1 decline in the VIX futures. Remember, our options are PRICED with volatility as a pricing mechanism -- it is ONE of THREE Factors which determine the prices of options.
>1. Time of the contract 
>2. Strike in relation to underlying and
>3. Volatility, or risk assumed (are u selling in a storm? Or in sunny skies?

>So if the VIX drops by $1, we can expect to our short options to decline in value by $484.00.

>Vega is crucially important when the market is GOING SOUTH FAST. The VEGA will spike and it will LOOK LIKE you are losing a ton of money, and when "marked to market" you technically are... but the truth is, if you are patient and let volatility MEAN REVERT, it will come back -- and when it does, so will your account. * See example below.

>The biggest mistake you can make in trading this way is giving in to fear while watching your account SLOWLY BLEED DOWN by option price inflation caused by IV spikes.

>For example, if you have an OTM short SPX option that is priced at $98.00 because the market has just gone south 7 days straight, buying back that option is a huge mistake. Since it is still OTM, that means most of that $98 price is both VEGA and THETA. In other words, if the market flatlined until expiration, you'd stand to lose $9,800 in vega/theta decay.​
